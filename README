Finite Fire Mod for Minecraft
by donington


This mod changes the way fire works when gamerule doFireTick is set to true.

To enable the behavior of this mod, type the following as OP or at the server console:
  /gamerule doFireTick true

Set the rule back to false to revert back to normal fire behavior.


When doFireTick is set to true, fire spread will be disabled but fire will still extinguish like normal.
